# trackpad-is-too-damn-big

A customizable utility for Linux users to modify trackpad behavior.

## Features

- **Crop Specific Areas**: Completely disable designated areas of the trackpad based on specified percentages from the edges.
- **Flex Action Control**: Disable initial actions from specified areas while allowing entry from valid areas and recognition of multitouch gestures. This ensures that the entire trackpad area remains usable, and gestures are registered correctly without restrictions.
